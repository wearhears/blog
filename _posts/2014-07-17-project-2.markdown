description: Our solution is packaged to cover a two-tier feature of hEARS as a product. The first tier is intended to allow elderlies using hEARS to be able to gain access to public health information and services announcement via a service provider, and, the second tier, provides elderlies a reminder mechanism for them to have their right medication intakes on time.
